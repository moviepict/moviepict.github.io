<p>My Symbiote Peeves, or a Practice in Me Handling, Or it could be something like the hybrid: While the sequel to 2018�s venom sees the birth of cletus kasady�s carnage (woody harrelson), the climactic battle between the serial killer and the lethal protector results in a new symbiote potentially being born known as toxin, the symbiote son of carnage and grandson of venom, being one the most powerful symbiote.</p>
