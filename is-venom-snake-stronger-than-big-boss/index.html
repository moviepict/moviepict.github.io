<p>Metal Gear Solid V Chronicles of Outer Heaven (MGS, The reality that solid snake sees turns out to align rather well with that of big boss. The revelation of venom snake taking over outer heaven effectively means that the final boss of the original game wasn�t big boss but venom snake while the true big boss continued to operate. Solid snake managed to defeat venom only with a ♥♥♥♥ing.</p>

The public perception of big boss. Overral, i think that that plot twist was not handled correctly and that it�s kind of a useless recton. By 1995, venom snake would just go by the title big boss.</p>

<p>What MGSV Ground Zeros Taught Me to Expect from Metal, Venom snake has exceptionally good feats (arguably better than any naked snake had) and although him (a normal man) shouldn�t be able to contend with big boss (a.

<p>POSSIBLE EVIDENCE the story of MGSV will take place over, If venom is better, that contradicts with big boss� title of ��the greatest soldier of the 20th century��. So, between the two, i�d wager that venom snake has the upper hand in terms of sheer ability. And this badass was able to withstand multiple rockets to the face before he went down. Skull face’s idea would have tarnished big boss.</p>

<p>Liquid Snake Embraces Conflict in Death Battle! by, He was more moves than big boss, runs at higher speeds, and imagine taking a head butt from the guy. Big boss, due to the environmental advantage, followed by snake. Solid snake managed to defeat venom only with a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket launcher!

<p>What MGSV Ground Zeros Taught Me to Expect from Metal, Venom�s gear is good, but he lacks physical capability and solid�s gear isn�t too far behind. But the success of venom must’ve come as a huge surprise, impressing even big boss. He was created to be the rock star, not the artist. He gets the stamp of approval from ocelot and takes down everyone. Sutherland�s performance garnered praise from critics,.</p>

<p>Which Metal Gear Character Are You Based On Your Zodiac, Big boss is absolutely a bastard by the time of mgsv. The best time of snake is in metal gear solid, 10 years after his first confrontation with big boss, where snake was just a rookie. Overral, i think that that plot twist was not handled correctly and that it�s kind of a useless recton. It�s not like venom is.</p>

Venom snake is the most empowering protagonist in the series to play as. The existence of venom snake operating under the guise of big boss only helped build big boss� reputation, even as it veered more villainous than big boss� actual activities. Snake doesn’t know this, of course, but that doesn’t prevent him from killing either venom or big boss.</p>
