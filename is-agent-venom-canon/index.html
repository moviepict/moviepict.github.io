<p>Death Battle] Venom (Marvel) vs. Crona (Soul, I would absolutely not use a gem on him, though. Venom then becomes the new intergalactic ambassador of earth and an agent of the cosmos. Man it is crazy that in marvel canon you would not have luke cage, wolverine, agent venom or man thing without captain america.

<p>Venom, Page 3 of 7 Inverse, In other words, the symbiote is completely a good guy now. Joining the military after graduating from high school, he lost his legs while saving a fellow soldier in iraq. Its touch is very painful to venom and its host, and prolonged contact will eventually kill it. During which agent venom is killed by a poison hulk. Yes, carnage usa.</p>
<h3 id="recently-in-the-comics-flash-thompson-agent-venom-had-his-symbiote-cleansed">Recently in the comics, flash thompson, agent venom, had his symbiote “cleansed”.</h3><p>Yes, carnage usa is canon (it was canon even before the absolute carnage event but ok) it�s even mentioned by misty knight while she�s searching for agent. An alternate version of agent venom joined the venom army after being recruited by a venomized doctor strange to fight the poisons. Corporal eugene “flash” thompson, agent venom origin: I would absolutely not use a gem on him, though. Now, most fans have shown an interest in following agent venom�s stories through trade paperbacks, so i�ll be focusing on those only.</p>
