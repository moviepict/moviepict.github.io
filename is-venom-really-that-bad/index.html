<p>And then eddy and venom never bring it up again and eddy never asks how venom survived. To be fair to the many critics that gave their warnings of the film flaws, venom did suffer from a rushed third act with a climactic fight that was too visually intricate for its own good. Between the premise and the approach, it feels like much of the venom backlash comes from treating the movie as something it fundamentally isn�t.

<p>Maybe it’s just because the cgi is really bad, but i like watching two weirdos played by tom hardy just bicker and fight a lot more than i enjoy watching two jelly monsters throw each other around. Most of the action sequences are woefully bad in both execution and visuals. It�s a bad serious film in the same way it�s a bad cosmic adventure: Stephanie zackarek at time magazine says “on. It has a terrible plot, it has no twists, it�s soooo predictable, the characters are boring, and it�s just altogether bad. We are waiting for venom 2:</p>
